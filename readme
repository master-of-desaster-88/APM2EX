based on the Mav2Duplex code V0.1 by DevFor8.com - info@devfor8.com

Hardware 
- Arduino Pro Mini (or similar) with 5V / 16Mhz and ATMega 328
- 4.7k resistor 
- GND/RX connection to Mavlink capable board (Arducopter/MegaPirateNG) with OSD telemetry output allowed (same config as MinimOSD)
- servo connector for connection between Arduino and Jeti receiver (insert into telemetry socket)
- Duplex Ex capable transmitter (new Jeti transmitter or Jetibox Profi)

Troubleshooting 
- Arduino reseting
* measure your voltage for RC. If it is bellow or on 5V, connect to VCC instead of RAW pin on Arduino (!!WARNING , Higher than 5V voltage can smoke your Arduino)
