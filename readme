APM2EX
Version 1.1 schiwo1@gmail.com
based on the Mav2Duplex code V0.1 by DevFor8.com - info@devfor8.com
Changes V1.1:
- Capacity calculation fixed
- NOTE: no support of the old Jetibox Mini (non EX protocol)

Features V1.0:
The following parameters are tranferred to the Jeti EX transmitter:
- Armed: 0=disarmed; 1=armed
- Batt%: remaining battery capacity (0-100%)
- Voltage: battery voltage
- Current: actual current measured by the 3DR power sensor
- Capacity: actual drawn battery capacity
- Climb: climb speed in m/s
- Lat: latitude in degrees (requires GPS)
- Lon: longitude in degrees (requires GPS)
- Home Dir: home direction heading
- Home dist: distance to recorded home point in meter (requires GPS)
- HDOP: HDOP value (1-10) - only fly with a HDOP <2!
- GPS-Lock: 0=no GPS, 1=GPS, no fix, 2=2D fix, 3=3D fix
- GPS Sat: number of found satellites
- Speed: horizonal groundspeed (GPS) in m/s

Hardware 
- Arduino Pro Mini (or similar) with 5V / 16Mhz and ATMega 328
- 4.7k resistor 
- GND/RX connection to Mavlink capable board (Arducopter/MegaPirateNG) with OSD telemetry output allowed (same config as MinimOSD)
- servo connector for connection between Arduino and Jeti receiver (insert into telemetry socket)
- Duplex Ex capable transmitter (new Jeti transmitter or Jetibox Profi)

Troubleshooting 
- Arduino reseting
* measure your voltage for RC. If it is bellow or on 5V, connect to VCC instead of RAW pin on Arduino (!!WARNING , Higher than 5V voltage can smoke your Arduino)
- Do not connect the sensor in parallel to a 433/900MHz Telemetry downlink to the same Telemertry port. Use a separate port or connect the sensor parallel to an OSD instead.
